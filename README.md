WhatWhen
========

**HEADS UP:** I haven't had a lot of time to maintain this app/code base so a lot of stuff is out of date. It's highly recommended that if you find something arwy and you'd like to fix it, **shoot me a PR and I'll merge it in**. Also if you want to play around, just fork a copy and have fun! 

**P.S.** If you're interested in helping me maintain this, shoot me an email and we can talk: ryan@properapp.com.

WhatWhen is an app for freelancers to help with managing project timelines. 

It's built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com) and 100% free. Thought it may be helpful to share the source code for anyone looking to learn a bit more about the framework.

No promises on tidy code :) If you have questions about how/why I did something, shoot me an email: ryan@whatwhenapp.com.

You can check out and sign up for the app here: http://whatwhenapp.com. 

If you like this, I'd also suggest checking out Proper, another app I'm working on to manage freelance contracts: http://properapp.com.
